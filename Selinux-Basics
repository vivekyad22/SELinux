At any one time, SELinux can be in any of three possible modes:

Enforcing
Permissive
Disabled

In enforcing mode SELinux will enforce its policy on the Linux system and make sure any unauthorized access attempts by users and processes are denied. The access denials are also written to relevant log files. We will talk about SELinux policies and audit logs later.

Permissive mode is like a semi-enabled state. SELinux doesn't apply its policy in permissive mode, so no access is denied. However any policy violation is still logged in the audit logs. It's a great way to test SELinux before enforcing it.

The disabled mode is self-explanatory – the system won't be running with enhanced security.

Checking SELinux Modes and Status
We can run the getenforce command to check the current SELinux mode.
getenforce
SELinux should currently be disabled, so the output will look like this:
Disabled
We can also run the sestatus command:
sestatus
When SELinux is disabled the output will show:
SELinux status:        disabled

SELinux Configuration File
cat /etc/selinux/config

The SELINUXTYPE directive determines the policy that will be used. The default value is targeted. With a targeted policy, SELinux allows you to customize and fine tune access control permissions. The other possible value is "MLS" (multilevel security), an advanced mode of protection. Also with MLS, you need to install an additional package.

setenforce enforcing

To understand policy, we have to learn some basic terminology. We will go into the details later, but here is a brief introduction. An SELinux policy defines user access to roles, role access to domains, and domain access to types.
