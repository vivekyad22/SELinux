# SELinux

SELinux is a way to fine-tune such access control requirements. With SELinux, you can define what a user or process can do. It confines every process to its own domain so the process can interact with only certain types of files and other processes from allowed domains. This prevents a hacker from hijacking any process to gain system-wide access.
